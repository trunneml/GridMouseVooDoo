GridMouseVooDoo
===============

This program makes it possible to move and resize windows into a gird structure.
It makes nearly the same as the compiz-grid-plugin, but only with the mouse and
without a keyboard interaction.


Usage
-----

Press the defined mouse button to mark the grid zones. The window will resized
and moved to fit the marked zones when you release the button.

The default layout looks like this:

    +--+-+-+--+
    |  | | |  |
    +--+-+-+--+
    |  | | |  |
    +--+-+-+--+

    
Requirements

 * xprop
 * wmctrl
 
And a EWMH/NetWM compatible X Window Manager (Normally the most Linux Window
Manager).
