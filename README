GridMouseVooDoo
===============

This program makes it possible to move and resize windows into a gird structure.
It makes nearly the same as the compiz-grid-plugin, but only with the mouse and
without a keyboard interaction.


Usage
-----

1. Define your mouse button in mouse.py.
2. Start mouse.py for the command line or create an autostart entry.
3. After that just press the defined mouse button to mark the grid zones.
   The window will resized and moved to fit the marked zones,
   when you release the button.

The default layout looks like this:

    +--+-+-+--+
    |  | | |  |
    +--+-+-+--+
    |  | | |  |
    +--+-+-+--+

    
Requirements
------------

 * xprop
 * wmctrl
 
And a EWMH/NetWM compatible X Window Manager (Normally the most Linux Window
Manager).
