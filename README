GridMouseVooDoo
===============

This program makes it possible to move and resize windows into a gird structure.
It makes nearly the same as the compiz-grid-plugin, but only with the mouse and
without a keyboard interaction.


Usage
-----

1. Define your mouse button in mouse.py.
2. Start mouse.py for the command line or create an autostart entry.
3. Just press the defined mouse button to mark the grid zones.
4. The window will be resized and moved to fit the marked zones.

The default layout looks like this:

    +--+-+-+--+
    |  | | |  |
    +--+-+-+--+
    |  | | |  |
    +--+-+-+--+

    
Requirements
------------

wmctrl and a EWMH/NetWM compatible X Window Manager (Normally most window
managers under Linux).
