# MouseWindowManager


This program makes it possible to move and resize windows into a simple gird
structure. It's easier to use then most tiling window managers.

It is inspired by the compiz-grid-plugin, but uses the mouse to
resize and reposition the window.

## Usage

Just press your hot key, normally one of the extra mouse buttons and draw a
line, to mark the grid fields. The window will be repositioned and resized to 
fit into the marked gird areas.

The grid splits you monitor like that:


          1/3 1/2 2/3
    +------+---+---+------+
    |      |   |   |      |
    +------+---+---+------+   1/2
    |      |   |   |      |
    +------+---+---+------+




## Linux Installation

The Linux version is Python2 script and uses the command line tool wmctrl to
control the windows.

1. Install *wmctrl* and *python2*
2. Define your mouse button in `linux/mouse.py`.
3. Start mouse.py for the command line or use the autostart entry in 
   the same folder.

**Note**: You need a EWMH/NetWM compatible X Window Manager (Normally most window
managers under Linux).
